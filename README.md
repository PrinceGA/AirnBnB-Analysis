This is a project undertaken to help a client analyze the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City. This project involved independent analysis and provided valuable insights into investment opportunities.

The goal of this project was to analyze current Airbnb listings in Manhattan and provide guidance on which types of properties the client should invest in. The analysis aimed to identify trends, popular property types, and optimal neighborhoods for investment.

The data was collected from the Airbnb platform and included various attributes spread across multiple files:

The data is sourced from the Airbnb platform.

## The Process
I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values. Then, I merged DataFrames from different sources and analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

### Data Cleaning
